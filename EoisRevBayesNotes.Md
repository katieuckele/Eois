# Inferring dated *Eois* phylogeny with RevBayes

## Determining the prior node distributions

From Strutzenberger et al. 2017

"Neotropical Eois were dated to an age of 24.2Ma (20.3â€“28.4Ma 95%HPD)."

## Determining the sampling proportion

From Strutzenberger and Fiedler, 2011: 

"Hence, the overall species count of Eois is likely to be considerably higher than 250, and a rough estimate yields total species numbers for Neotropical Eois somewhere from 733 to 1710 species (G. Brehm, F. Bodner, P. Strutzenberger, F. Hunefeld & K. Fiedler,
submitted). 

From Brehm et al., 2011: 

"Simple richness estimations based on the ratio of described versus undescribed species lead to values between 733 and 1,710 Neotropical Eois species in total (Table 2)."
